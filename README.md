## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20.0.0
- **PostgreSQL** >= 14
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized development)
- **API Key** for OpenAI or Anthropic

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended for Local Development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/steven-d-pennington/ClearSide.git
cd ClearSide

# Copy and configure environment files
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env

# Edit .env.docker and backend/.env with your API keys
# Set LLM_PROVIDER (openai or anthropic)
# Set OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Start all services
npm run docker:up

# Backend will be available at http://localhost:3001
# Frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173
# PostgreSQL will be available at localhost:5432
```

**Docker Commands:**
```bash
npm run docker:up            # Start services
npm run docker:down          # Stop services
npm run docker:logs          # View all logs
npm run docker:logs:backend  # View backend logs only
npm run docker:logs:frontend # View frontend logs only
npm run docker:shell:backend # Access backend shell
npm run docker:shell:db      # Access PostgreSQL shell
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database and API credentials

# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Set VITE_API_URL to your backend URL (default: http://localhost:3001)

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Verify Installation

1. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser
2. Enter a question like: "Should cities impose a moratorium on new AI data centers?"
3. Configure your debate:
   - **Preset**: Try "Deep Dive" for comprehensive analysis
   - **Mode**: Select "Lively" for interruption-enabled debate
   - **Personas**: Assign "The Theorist" (Pro) vs "The Pragmatist" (Con)
   - **Models**: Enable OpenRouter multi-model (if configured)
4. Click "Start Debate" and watch the live debate unfold
5. Try pausing and asking a clarifying question
6. Export as Markdown or Audio when complete

---

## 📖 How It Works

ClearSide offers two debate modes to match your needs:

### Debate Modes

#### 🎙️ Turn-Based Mode (Classic)
Structured, formal debates following the traditional 6-phase protocol with clear turn-taking.

#### ⚡ Lively Debate Mode (Experimental)
**The world's first AI interruption-enabled debate system.**

Experience debates that feel like live podcast recordings:
- **Real-Time Interruptions**: Agents can interrupt each other based on relevance and contradiction detection
- **Dynamic Pacing**: Choose from Slow, Medium, Fast, or Frantic pacing modes
- **Intelligent Triggers**: Interruptions fire when opposing agent detects contradictions or weak arguments
- **Safe Boundaries**: Interrupts happen at sentence breaks for natural flow
- **Podcast-Ready Audio**: TTS export preserves interruptions with realistic cross-talk timing
- **Configurable Aggression**: Control interrupt frequency (1-5) and cooldown periods

**How Lively Mode Works:**
1. Agents stream responses token-by-token in real-time
2. Interruption engine evaluates opposing agent's content every 250-2000ms (pacing-dependent)
3. When relevance score exceeds threshold, interrupt is scheduled at next safe boundary
4. Interrupted agent yields mid-sentence with truncated utterance
5. Interrupter fires brief interjection (1-2 sentences)
6. Original speaker may resume or yield floor
7. TTS export creates podcast-style audio with realistic overlap

**Perfect for:** Heated policy debates, adversarial analysis, podcast-style content

### The 6-Phase ClearSide Debate Protocol (Turn-Based)

1. **📝 Proposition Normalization** - Orchestrator clarifies the question and scope
2. **🎯 Opening Statements** - Pro and Con agents present their core positions
3. **🔄 Dialectical Exchange** - 3 rounds of direct argumentation and rebuttals
4. **🔍 Evidence Deep Dive** - Examination of key facts, projections, and analogies
5. **❓ User Q&A** - Direct responses to user interventions and clarifications
6. **📊 Moderator Synthesis** - Neutral summary highlighting decision hinges (no winner declared)

### Agent Roles

| Agent | Purpose | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Orchestrator** | Normalizes propositions | Clarifies scope, defines terms, identifies context |
| **Pro Advocate** | Argues FOR the proposition | Steel-man quality, explicit assumptions, cites evidence |
| **Con Advocate** | Argues AGAINST the proposition | Steel-man quality, explicit assumptions, cites evidence |
| **Moderator** | Synthesizes the debate | Neutral, no winner, highlights uncertainties and decision hinges |

### User Interventions

During any phase, users can:
- **⏸️ Pause** - Stop the debate to reflect
- **❓ Ask Question** - Request clarification on a specific point
- **📎 Inject Evidence** - Add facts or sources to the debate
- **🔄 Request Clarification** - Ask an agent to elaborate on their reasoning

## 🌟 Key Innovations

ClearSide introduces several first-of-their-kind features in AI debate systems:

### 1. Conversational Podcast Mode
**Talk show-style AI discussions** with natural conversation flow:
- 2-6 AI personas with distinct backstories and speaking styles
- Host agent that introduces guests, asks probing questions, steers discussion
- Hybrid flow control: Host steers, but participants can signal desire to speak
- Shared context board tracking topics, claims, agreements, and disagreements
- Native podcast export preserving the talk show format

### 2. Duelogic Research & RAG
**Automated research pipeline** for discovering and generating episode content:
- Perplexity integration discovers trending ethical/moral topics via web search
- LLM generates episode proposals matching Duelogic format
- Vector database (Pinecone) indexes research for RAG during debates
- Debate agents cite real sources gathered during research

### 3. Lively Debate Mode
**First AI interruption-enabled debate system** that creates natural, dynamic conversations with:
- Real-time relevance and contradiction detection
- Safe boundary interruption (sentence-aware)
- Configurable pacing modes (Slow → Frantic)
- Podcast-style audio export with preserved interruptions

### 4. Persona System
**6 distinct argumentation archetypes** that transform debate dynamics:
- Each persona has unique vocabulary, rhetorical style, and focus areas
- System prompt modifications ensure authentic personality differences
- Mix and match personas for Pro vs Con (e.g., Theorist vs Pragmatist)

### 5. OpenRouter Multi-Model Debates
**Pit different LLMs against each other** in the same debate:
- Auto-pairing with cost optimization
- 100+ models across all major providers
- Real-time cost estimation
- Tier-based smart matching (Frontier vs Mid-tier vs Budget)

### 6. Hybrid Live-Replay Model
**Every debate is both live AND replayable:**
- Watch debates unfold in real-time with full participation
- Instantly replay any completed debate with timeline scrubbing
- Export to text, audio, or video formats
- Phase-based navigation

### 7. Steel-Man Quality Enforcement
**No straw-man arguments allowed:**
- Agents must construct strongest possible opposing arguments
- Moderator neutrality validation (never picks a winner)
- Explicit assumption surfacing in every claim
- Uncertainty preservation (no false confidence)
