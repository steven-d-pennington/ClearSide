## Reaction Clips Status

Reaction clips are short audio interjections (e.g., "Mm-hmm", "Exactly", "That's right") generated for each voice to create the illusion of a shared room during podcasts.

| Persona | Voice | Reactions Generated |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| Dr. Viktor Hartmann | Charon | ❌ Cleared (needs regeneration with German accent context) |
| *Other personas* | Various | Check Admin Config page for status |

**To generate reactions:**
1. Go to Admin → Configuration → Podcast Personas
2. Click "Generate" or "Regenerate" for each persona
3. Reactions are generated with character context (speaking style, backstory, accent)

## Notes

1. **Shared Voice:** Quinn (Host) and Dr. Viktor Hartmann both use Charon. This works because Quinn is the host and Viktor is a guest - they don't typically speak simultaneously.

2. **Accent Handling:** Gemini TTS supports director's notes for styling. Characters with accents (Viktor's German, JB's Southern) should have that context passed during generation.

3. **Voice Selection Criteria:**
   - Match gender to persona unless artistically intentional
   - Match energy level (calm personas get measured voices, energetic personas get upbeat voices)
   - Consider the voice description's fit with the character's speaking style
