## Proposition

**Question:** Should AI data centers be subject to a moratorium?

**Context:** Discussing environmental and economic impacts

**Original Input:** Should we ban AI data centers?

---

## Arguments FOR

*AI data centers pose significant environmental risks due to their massive energy consumption and resource usage.*

### Key Arguments

#### 1. Data centers consume enormous amounts of electricity, contributing to carbon emissions.

**Category:** Environmental
**Evidence Type:** Statistical
**Confidence:** 🟢 High

Data centers consume enormous amounts of electricity, contributing to carbon emissions.

#### 2. Water usage for cooling is unsustainable in drought-prone regions.
